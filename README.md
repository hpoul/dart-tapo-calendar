# TaPo-Calendar Widget
A "Simple" HTML calendar widget which allows you to display events overlayed a Calendar.

See http://hpoul.github.com/dart-tapo-calendar/page/example.html

## Limitations

Currently it only supports displaying of events and of single days.

## Roadmap

It's currently in a very early phase - so nothing than displaying of 
predefined events are currently supported. But more is sure to come!

* Allow modifications by the user
* Allow modifications after initialization
* Different "zoom" levels
* Multiple days in one widget
* etc.
